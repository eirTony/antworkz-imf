= Introduction =

Worker classes derived from WorkLib:AbstractWorker
have a short lifespan.
They are created, provided with a current configuration
and input data and are expected to provide results
then fizzle into history. 

The worker machine maintains work contexts for use
by its workers.
They are basically read only, but a few circumstances
call for writing to a context.
These will be discussed below followed by example
contexts noting each one's characteristic.

= Characteristics =

|| CharCode || Name || Description ||
|| Fixed || Fixed Read Only || Will not change during the life of machine ||
|| SubRO || Subscriber Read Only || Worker will not change; machine may change based upon message from Publisher ||
|| PublWO || Publisher Write Only || TBD whether these will be contexts ||
|| Mirror || Publisher's Mirror ||  TBD whether these will be contexts ||
|| Update || Periodic Update Read/Write || Statistics collector (See Note 1 for example) ||
