#summary Checklist for promoting a source code release.
#labels Phase-Implementation

= Introduction =

This note will provide a series of steps to promote a source code-base
from develop to release branch.

= Details =

# SVN switch to develop branch, ensure it compiles and tests at the start.

# For each active development branch:

 # SVN switch to the branch, ensure it compiles and tests at the start.

 # SVN switch back to develop branch.

 # SVN merge the branch into develop branch. [Note: Do not commit at this point.]

 # Attempt to edit all conflicts to resolve them
  * If the conflicts become to difficult, cancel the merge and SVN revert back to develop.

 # Make develop+branch rebuild compile and test correctly.
  * If the compile or test errors become too difficult SVN revert back to develop.

[Note: If at this point you are reverting more than committing, 
consider abandoning this release.]
 
 # SVN commit the develop changes from this branch.
