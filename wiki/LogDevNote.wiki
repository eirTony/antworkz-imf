#summary Making best use of AntWorkz Logging Facility

= Introduction =

AntWorkz provides a powerful Logging Facility that gets smarter as 
each AntWorkz library level becomes available.


= Library Level Support =

See the AntWorkzLibraries for an explanation of the support available
at each of the three Library Levels: *core*, *support*, and *worker*. 

== Core Level ==

=== Base Sub-level ===

At the core library level, 
the log items reside only in an in-memory queue for the individual process. 
Log 'forks' can be started to receive text streams of the log items
as they are processed.
Only basic message formatting (via QVariant::toString()) is available
at the BaseLib core library level.

=== Full Sub-level ===

With the full core level library classes are available 
(in particular, DataLib: Printable and/or Readable classes),
more sophistication is used in formatting messages.
And, with DataLib: Streamable and/or VarElement classes,
stream (binary or text) and XML file outputs become viable.

== Support Level ==

Switch to base configuration.
Start LogThread.
...

== Worker Level ==

Worker MessageQueue based logging.
Push log items to the cloud.
