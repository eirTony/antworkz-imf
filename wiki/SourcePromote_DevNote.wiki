#summary Checklist for promoting a source code release.

= Introduction =

This note will provide a series of steps to promote a source code-base
from a development branch to the develop branch, from develop to current,
from current to release, and finally from release to trunk (master).

== To develop ==

   # For each active development branch (or a specific if desired):

     # SVN switch to the development branch, ensure it compiles and tests at the start in release mode.

    # SVN merge develop into the development branch

    # Attempt to edit all conflicts to resolve them

    # Make develop+branch rebuild compile and test correctly.


 # SVN merge develop into branch. Test. Fix.

 # SVN merge the branch into develop branch. [Note: Do not commit at this point.]

  * If the merge, compile, or test errors become too difficult SVN revert back to the current develop branch.

[Note: If at this point you are reverting more than committing, 
consider abandoning this release.]
 
 # SVN commit the develop changes from this branch.
